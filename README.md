# presto
Issues repository for Presto, a CCAAS (CSV2API conversion as a service).

Please use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/stevenbeeckman/presto/issues) to request new features (private spreadsheets anyone?) or to (obviously) report issues with the current web app. 

I'm open to receive funding for growing this into something scalable and profitable. Mention me, [@stevenbeeckman](https://twitter.com/stevenbeeckman), on Twitter to engage.
